    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="legal-date">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>These terms govern your use of NeverMiss ("the Service"), a Chrome extension and related server infrastructure provided by NeverMiss ("we", "us", "our"). By installing or using NeverMiss, you agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>NeverMiss is a Chrome extension that integrates with Gmail to provide email open tracking, follow-up reminders, deal context management, stale deal nudges, and send-time signals. The Service includes the browser extension, the tracking server, the website at nevermiss.team, and any related services.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 16 years old to use NeverMiss. By using the Service, you represent that you meet this requirement and have the authority to agree to these terms.</p>

    <h2>3. Account</h2>
    <p>NeverMiss generates a random, anonymous user identifier stored locally in your browser. This identifier is used to associate your tracked emails with your extension instance. There is no account registration process. If you subscribe to Pro, your email address is associated with your user identifier for billing purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Free and Pro Plans</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Free Plan</strong>: Includes unlimited email tracking (with "Tracked with NeverMiss" branding), 10 active follow-ups, open counts without timestamps, and all other core features. The Free Plan is available at no cost for as long as we offer the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Pro Plan</strong>: Available for $9.99/month. Includes removal of branding, unlimited follow-ups, full open timeline with timestamps, real-time notifications, and other premium features. Pro subscriptions are billed monthly through Stripe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Payments and Billing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pro subscriptions are processed by <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. By subscribing, you also agree to Stripe's terms of service.</li>
      <li>Subscriptions renew automatically each month until cancelled.</li>
      <li>You can cancel your subscription at any time through the billing portal accessible from the extension. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period.</li>
      <li>We do not offer refunds for partial months. If you cancel mid-month, you retain Pro access until the end of your billing period.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to change pricing with 30 days' notice. Price changes do not affect existing subscriptions until the next renewal after the notice period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use NeverMiss to send spam or unsolicited bulk email.</li>
      <li>Use the Service in violation of any applicable email laws (CAN-SPAM, GDPR, etc.).</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or extract the source code of the extension.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or servers.</li>
      <li>Use automated tools to create multiple accounts or abuse free tier limits.</li>
      <li>Resell or redistribute the Service without written permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Email Tracking Compliance</h2>
    <p>NeverMiss provides email tracking functionality. You are responsible for complying with all applicable laws regarding email tracking in your jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions may require you to disclose that your emails are tracked. We provide the "Tracked with NeverMiss" branding on free-tier emails, which serves as disclosure. Pro users who remove branding are responsible for ensuring their own compliance.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>NeverMiss and all related content, features, and functionality are owned by NeverMiss and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service in accordance with these terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>NeverMiss is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</li>
      <li>Email tracking will detect every open event (email clients may block tracking pixels).</li>
      <li>Send-time signals will guarantee higher open rates.</li>
      <li>The Service will be compatible with all email clients or configurations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, NeverMiss shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, or goodwill arising from your use of the Service.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from or related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the 12 months preceding the claim, or $100, whichever is greater.</p>

    <h2>11. Service Changes and Termination</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service at any time with reasonable notice.</li>
      <li>We may terminate your access if you violate these terms.</li>
      <li>You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling the extension.</li>
      <li>Upon termination, your local data is deleted automatically. Server-side data can be deleted upon request.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the extension or website. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall be resolved in the courts of the state where NeverMiss is headquartered.</p>
